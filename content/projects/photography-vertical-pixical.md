### Target Persona: "Paparazzo Pete"

- **Age:** 32 years old
- **Occupation:** Accountant by day, photography enthusiast by passion
- **Challenge:** Overwhelmed by the abundance of online photography resources with no structure
- **Goal:** A flexible, async learning platform with personalized feedback from a skilled photography coach
- **Pain:** Fumbles with camera settings and editing tools, wishes for guided help through the complexities

## Problem Statement

Key pain points identified for beginner hobbyists:

### High Priority

1. **Lack of structured guidance:** Beginners struggle to find a clear, step-by-step learning path from basics to advanced techniques. They have difficulty understanding where to start and what to learn next.

2. **Limited feedback and personalized support:** In asynchronous online learning environments, beginners often don't have access to personalized support or timely feedback from their coaches.

3. **Balancing learning with other commitments:** Many beginner hobbyists have work, school, or family commitments that make it difficult to find time to consistently practice and learn.

### Medium Priority

4. **Overwhelming amount of information:** Countless photography resources online make it hard to identify which sources are reliable or relevant.

5. **Difficulty in staying motivated:** Learners may lose motivation if they do not see progress or improvement in their skills over time.

### Low Priority

6. **Technical challenges:** Camera settings, composition, and editing can feel intimidating. While important, this can be addressed over time through easy-to-understand resources and tools.

## Product Strategy

Based on the prioritization and analysis, the broad product strategy can be summarized into five themes:

1. **Structured Learning Path:** Develop a comprehensive and well-organized curriculum that guides beginner hobbyists through a clear learning journey, from basic to advanced topics.

2. **Personalized Feedback and Support:** Implement a system that enables learners to receive timely, personalized feedback and support from their coaches and peers.

3. **Flexibility and Time Management:** Design the course to accommodate learners' busy schedules, allowing them to progress at their own pace.

4. **Streamlined Content and Learning Objectives:** Curate and present content in a way that reduces information overload, with clear learning objectives and summaries for each module.

5. **Motivation and Engagement:** Incorporate gamification, progress tracking, goal-setting tools, and peer interaction opportunities.
