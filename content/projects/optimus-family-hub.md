## Background

Optimus, a neobanking platform currently serving individual users, is exploring expansion into family banking — a segment uniquely shaped by Indian household dynamics where financial decisions are often collective and multi-generational.

## The Challenge

How might we design a family banking experience that respects the complexity of Indian family structures while providing modern digital banking convenience?

### Key Questions

- What does "family banking" mean for different types of Indian households?
- How do we balance individual financial autonomy with family financial coordination?
- What are the trust, privacy, and control dynamics at play?

## Research Approach

### User Research

Conducted 20+ in-depth interviews across three household archetypes:

1. **Nuclear families** — dual-income couples with children, focused on shared savings goals
2. **Joint families** — multi-generational households with pooled finances and hierarchical decision-making
3. **Semi-independent families** — adult children living separately but financially connected to parents

### Key Insights

- **73%** of respondents manage at least one shared financial goal with family members
- **Trust asymmetry** — parents want visibility into children's spending, but not vice versa
- **Allowance management** is the #1 requested feature for families with teenage children
- Existing solutions (shared accounts, UPI groups) feel "clunky" and lack proper controls

## Product Strategy

### Phased Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Foundation (Months 1-3)**
- Family group creation with role-based access (Admin, Member, Viewer)
- Shared expense tracking and split settlements
- Family savings pots with contribution tracking

**Phase 2 — Growth (Months 4-6)**
- Allowance management for dependents with spending controls
- Family budget dashboards with customizable visibility
- Automated savings rules (round-ups, scheduled transfers)

**Phase 3 — Expansion (Months 7-12)**
- Family insurance and investment products
- Multi-generational wealth planning tools
- Integration with external family financial commitments (EMIs, SIPs)

## Validation Framework

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Family group creation rate | 15% of active users | Monthly cohort tracking |
| Shared pot contributions | 3+ contributions/month | Transaction analytics |
| Feature retention (30-day) | 45% | Cohort retention curves |
| NPS for family features | 50+ | Quarterly survey |

### Risk Mitigation

- **Privacy concerns** — granular privacy controls from Day 1, with "private transactions" toggle
- **Family conflicts** — dispute resolution workflows, no single point of failure for access
- **Regulatory compliance** — minor accounts require guardian KYC, clear consent flows

## Outcome

The family banking strategy was validated through a 500-user beta program, resulting in:

- **2.3x higher engagement** compared to individual-only users
- **35% increase in deposits** within family savings pots
- Strong qualitative feedback on the allowance management feature
- Greenlit for full rollout with Phase 1 feature set
